    These are the instructions & text to put in the popup:



    This extension injects a video streaming button into the movie and tv show pages of IMDB. IMDB is the worlds largest movie database and contains info on just about every movie you can think of.



    Instructions:
    1. Navigate to <a href="https://imdb.com">IMDB</a>.
    2. Search for a movie or episode of a tv show. A "stream" button will appear under the trailer on the right hand side.
    3. Click the button to stream immediately.



    *****NOTE: If a stream button does NOT appear, that means that the movie or tv show episode you've selected is not available for streaming. If a video is available, the stream button will appear.*****
